Getting Started To get started: 1 2 $ npm install $ ./examples/wikipedia/stream Now look at the source that is being run open examples/wikipedia/main.sqrl Extending SQRL with functions and counters The sqrl package inscludes a base set of functions that should be common to any application. None of them require any extrenal network access or databases, and fulfil the basic needs of mathematics and simple text analysis. The sqrl-text-functions includes some more advanced text analysis functions such as RE2 regular expression based pattern matching, and simhash() which returns similar values for similar text. The real power of SQRL comes with its streaming counters. While the Redis database is not the best choice for large production systems, it is one of the most wildly available and easy to set up choices. The sqrl-redis-functions builds a couple of common counters on top of this database: count() countUnique() rateLimit() sessionize() These packages are all designed as examples, we built SQRL to be extendable with functions you need, as well as new databases as you require.
