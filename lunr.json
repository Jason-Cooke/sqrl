We wanted to provide a powerful tool but with a simple language that reads like SQL.

Getting Started To get started: 1 2 $ npm install $ ./examples/wikipedia/stream Now look at the source that is being run open examples/wikipedia/main.sqrl Extending SQRL with functions and counters The sqrl package inscludes a base set of functions that should be common to any application. None of them require any extrenal network access or databases, and fulfil the basic needs of mathematics and simple text analysis. The sqrl-text-functions includes some more advanced text analysis functions such as RE2 regular expression based pattern matching, and simhash() which returns similar values for similar text. The real power of SQRL comes with its streaming counters. While the Redis database is not the best choice for large production systems, it is one of the most wildly available and easy to set up choices. The sqrl-redis-functions builds a couple of common counters on top of this database: count() countUnique() rateLimit() sessionize() These packages are all designed as examples, we built SQRL to be extendable with functions you need, as well as new databases as you require.

While the Redis database is not the best choice for large production systems, it is one of the most wildly available and easy to set up choices. The sqrl-redis-functions builds a couple of common counters on top of this database: count() countUnique() rateLimit() sessionize() These packages are all designed as examples, we built SQRL to be extendable with functions you need, as well as new databases as you require."},"index.html#API-Reference":{"title":"API Reference","path":"/sqrl/index.html#API-Reference","body":"For detailed information view the API Reference ."},"server.html":{"title":"SQRL - Running as a Server","path":"/sqrl/server.html","body":"Running SQRL as a Server Starting One way of running SQRL in production is by running it as a stateless server: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 $ cat  ratelimit.sqrl LET Ip := input(); LET SqrlMutate := true; LET Remaining := rateLimit(BY Ip MAX 2 EVERY 30 SECONDS); CREATE RULE BlockedByRateLimit WHERE Remaining = 0; WHEN BlockedByRateLimit BLOCK ACTION; $ ./sqrl serve --port=2288 samples/ratelimit.sqrl Serving samples/ratelimit.sqrl on port 2288 Note that the server above will store all of its state in-memory.
