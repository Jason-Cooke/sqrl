A Safe, Stateful Rules Language for Event Streams This is a beta release . The code here was used by Smyte pre-acquisition but has not been tested in a production since it was extracted from the code base. We plan to work with the community on making it production ready, but we want to set expectations correctly. We hope you find it useful. :squirrel: Why SQRL At Smyte we needed a solution that would allow our customers to write their own rules to fight spam on their websites. We wanted to provide a powerful tool but with a simple language that reads like SQL. SQRL is a language and runtime that has been used to stop a variety of attacks on large social websites and marketplaces. Getting Started SQRL is designed to be used as a library, but the easiest way to see what it can do is to try out the command line interface. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 $ npm install --global sqrl-cli $ cat  simple.sqrl LET ActionData := input(); LET ActionName := jsonValue(ActionData, &apos;$.name&apos;); $ sqrl run simple.sqrl -s &apos;ActionData=name:login&apos; ActionName ✓ 2019-01-14 15:09 action was allowed. ActionName=login Once you’ve got that running, you can dive into our example section: Set up external state storage in Redis See a real-life use case on Wikipedia Extending SQRL with functions and counters The sqrl package inscludes a base set of functions that should be common to any application. None of them require any external network access or databases, and should fulfill your basic. We’ve included sqrl-text-functions which has more advanced text analysis functions such as RE2 regular expression based pattern matching, and simhash() which returns similar values for similar text.

Rate limiters limit the number of times an action can be performed over a certain time period. By combining multiple features together, rate limiters become quite powerful. Your first rate limiter A good first rate limiter is limiting the number of signups that can come from an individual IP address. You can begin by editing rules/actions/signup.sqrl (or the equivalent rules file for your signup action) and adding a rate limiter: rules/actions/signup.sqrl WHEN RULE QuickSignupsByIp WHERE rateLimited(BY Ip MAX 3 EVERY 10 MINUTES) ADD “possible_bot” TO Ip; The rateLimited function checks if the ratelimit has been hit. It has quite a few different options available. The ones in use here are: BY - The features to ratelimit by. Specifying multiple features (Ip, Machine) will group by each specific pair. MAX - The maximum number of actions allowed during the time period. In this case the first three events will not be ratelimited, but the fourth and onwards will. EVERY - How often the ratelimit will be reset. Valid timespan units are MONTHS, WEEKS, DAYS, HOURS, MINUTES, SECONDS. In this example, we’re rate limiting by Ip address, and allow a maximum of three signups every ten minutes. If a given Ipaddress is used in an action four or more times in a 10 minutes window, then we mark the Ip address that is used with a “possible_bot” label. Rate limits for feature combinations Our previous rate limiter does a decent job of slowing down bots, but it’s prone to false positives if an IP is shared amongst lots of users (like a university wifi access point). To reduce the false positive rate, we can increase the maxAmount for our existing NumSignups_TenMinutes_Ip rate limiter, and create a more strict rate limiter on a combination of features. For example, let’s make a new rate limiter that limits how often the actions may be taken on the pair (Ip, UserAgent). To implement this, every unique user agent appearing on a given IP gets its own quota. With our previous rate limiter, all user agents appearing on a given IP share a single quota. rules/actions/signup.sqrl WHEN RULE QuickSignupsByUserAgentOnIp WHERE rateLimited(BY Ip, UserAgent MAX 3 EVERY 10 MINUTES) ADD “possible_bot” TO Ip; Conditional rate limiters Often you only want to rate limit under certain conditions. We provide a WHERE statement inside the rateLimited clause that will allow you to check if the user was rate limited but only in the specified condition. An easy example of where that is useful is high value payments. The rule described below will allow any number of payments under $100, but only a maximum of two payment over that per day. rules/main.sqrl LET IsHighDollarPaymentAmount := PaymentAmountUsd = 100; CREATE RULE MultipleHighValuePurchasesByActorDay WHERE rateLimited(BY Actor MAX 2 EVERY DAY WHERE IsHighDollarPaymentAmount); A strikes system example You can use rate limiters to build advanced policies, such as a strikes system for rules. If you already have a rule in place and you want to give the user (or IP, or any combination of features) “3 strikes”, simply do the following: rules/main.sqrl CREATE RULE ThreeStrikesCheating WHERE rateLimited(BY Actor MAX 2 EVERY WEEK WHERE Cheated); We leave it up to the user to define the Cheated feature. To get started on that though you’ll want to review our featuresdocumentation. Conditional rate limiters behavior Sometimes you may only want a rate limiter to run if a given condition is met. For example, perhaps we want to limit the number of high-value purchases a user can make. rules/actions/payment LET IsHighDollarPaymentAmount := PaymentAmountUsd = 100; WHEN RULE MultipleHighValuePurchasesByActorDay WHERE rateLimited(BY Actor MAX 2 EVERY DAY WHERE IsHighDollarPaymentAmount) ADD “multiple_high_value” TO Actor; The statement above will allow each Actor to make a maximum of 2 payments for $100 or above each DAY. Once a specific Actor has made the two payments in one day the rate limit will be triggered and any future payments (even if they are less than $100) will be flagged. Conditions inside and outside of the rateLimited clause The position of the IsHighDollarPaymentAmount inside or outside of the rateLimited() function changes the behavior. As an example, within one twenty-four hour period a user made the following payments in order: $110, $30, $10, $120, $200, $50. rateLimited(BY Actor MAX 2 EVERY DAY) AND IsHighDollarPaymentAmount This would fire on all payments over $100, after the user had made two previous purchases that day. In the example given, it would fire on the $120, and $200 payments. rateLimited(BY Actor MAX 2 EVERY DAY WHERE IsHighDollarPaymentAmount) This would fire on all payments, after the user had made two previous purchases for over $100. In the given example, it would fire on the $200 and $50 payments. rateLimited(BY Actor MAX 2 EVERY DAY WHERE IsHighDollarPaymentAmount) AND IsHighDollarPaymentAmount This would fire on all payments over $100, after the user had made two previous purchases for over $100. In the given example it would only fire on the $200 purchase. Leaky buckets Up until this point, we’ve created rate limiters that refill their entire quota at the end of each period. It’s often more effective to utilize “leaky bucket” quota refills, where the quota slowly builds up over an extended period rather than all at once. This severely punishes attackers who continue to go over their quota, while minimizing the impact on legitimate behavior. Let’s add a leaky bucket rate limiter on the Simhash of every comment posted. A Simhash is a fuzzy text fingerprint of the comments text. By ratelimiting on that we ensure that the same (or very similar) text may only be sent a limited number of times by any actor throughout the system. This is a powerful way to automatically stop large-scale spam attacks without writing custom text content rules or rate limiting the actor, IP, or other connection characteristics. The following rate limiter limits an individual fuzzy text fingerprint may only be used 100 times a minute, and if the quota is exceeded the rate limit goes down to 10 times a minute. rules/actions/post_comment.sqrl WHEN RULE NumCommentsSimhash WHERE rateLimited(BY Simhash MAX 100 REFILL 10 EVERY MINUTE) ADD “similar_comments” TO Actor; Enabling strict mode Often when you create a ratelimit (such as the one above) you want to penalize the rate limited entity once their quota has been exhausted. To accomplish this, Smyte has created a special STRICT mode. Once an entity has been rate limited in STRICT mode they will be rate limited until the entire refill time period has passed. SQL WHEN RULE UserCommentBot WHERE rateLimited(BY Actor MAX 5 EVERY MINUTE STRICT) ADD “comment_bot” TO Actor;"},"language/textpattern.html":{"title":"","path":"/sqrl/language/textpattern.html","body":"Getting started As new spam campaigns emerge and existing ones change, it is important to be able to quickly update content rules. Smyte allows you to easily add or modify custom text patterns on the fly – we call this system Matchmaker. Creating rules that use Smyte Matchmaker is simple. Here’s an example of a rule that blocks any comments using a blacklisted keyword. SQL CREATE RULE UsedBlacklistedKeyword WHERE patternMatches(“BlacklistedKeywords”); The patternMatches returns back an array of extracted matches or an empty array if none are found (empty arrays evaluate to false in SQRL). Often times you would want to use the extracted matches in the rule’s reason. We can easily do that by updating the code to the following. SQL LET BlacklistedKeywordMatches := patternMatches(“BlacklistedKeywords”); CREATE RULE UsedBlacklistedKeyword WHERE BlacklistedKeywordMatches WITH REASON “Text used blacklisted keywords: ${BlacklistedKeywordMatches}”; Matching against specific text fields By default patternMatches will execute the given pattern against the UserGeneratedText feature. Sometimes you might want to run this against another feature. This is accomplished by providing the feature you want to run against as a second parameter to patternMatches.

This is where unique counts, or time windowed set cardinalities, come into play. Your first unique counter To get started we’re going to count the number of unique credit cards used over your entire account in the last twelve hours. While simple counters are restricted to a small number of windows, with our unique counters you can specify arbitrary time windows. rules/main.sqrl LET NumCreditCards := countUnique(CreditCard LAST 12 HOURS); Grouping unique counts It is rare that you just want to count unique values across your whole dataset. More often than not, you will be interested in counting unique values grouped by another feature. Let’s say we wanted to create a rule that blocks payments from users who have a suspicious number of credit cards. We could accomplish that with the following rule. rules/main.sqrl LET NumCreditCards := countUnique( CreditCard BY SessionActor LAST 5 DAYS); CREATE RULE SuspiciousNumCreditCards WHERE NumCreditCards  4; Now, rather than counting all the unique credit cards we have seen for everyone, we are counting the number of cards by each individual user. Counting with conditions and groups Let’s bring it together with an example that includes a WHERE condition as well. In this example we want to create a rule that picks up when a credit card is used in more than one risky country. We include the number of risky countries it has been seen in inside the rule reason. Finally we mark the rule as fully rolled out, and set it to both block the action and apply a bad_credit_card label to the card that was used. rules/main.sqrl LET NumRiskyCountries := countUnique( Country BY CreditCard WHERE RiskyCountry LAST 5 DAYS); CREATE RULE MultiRiskyCountryCreditCard WHERE NumRiskyCountries  1 WITH REASON “Credit card was used in ${NumRiskyCountries} risky “ “countries in last 5 days.” ROLLOUT TO 100%; WHEN MultiRiskyCountryCreditCard BLOCK ACTION ADD “bad_credit_card” TO CreditCard;"},"language/simple.html":{"title":"","path":"/sqrl/language/simple.html","body":"Another powerful tool at your disposal is the ability to flexibly count across multiple timespans. Let’s get started with a simple count. Your first counter In this example we are going to set up some counters for a message action in message.sqrl and make sure we include that from main.sqrl. Here’s an example of a simple counter that counts the number of action by a given SessionActor in the last week. rules/message.sqrl LET NumMessages := count(BY SessionActor LAST WEEK); rules/main.sqrl INCLUDE “message.sqrl” WHERE ActionName=”message”; Understanding the BY clause You can create a counter by one or more features. In the above example for each unique SessionActor we have created another counter of the number of actions performed in the last week. For certain use cases you’ll want to count pairwise features. Perhaps you’ll want to know the number of messages the given user sent on this Ip as compared to the number he has sent total. That is easy to do just by comma separating the features. rules/message.sqrl LET NumMessages := count(BY SessionActor LAST HOUR); LET NumIpMessages := count(BY SessionActor, Ip LAST HOUR); LET PercentMessagesByIp = 100 * (NumIpMessages / NumMessages); rules/main.sqrl INCLUDE “message.sqrl” WHERE ActionName=”message”; Available timespans The LAST clause specifies the timespan we want to count by. For simple counters we do not allow custom timespans, even though we do for unique counts. The list of available timespans are: TOTAL LAST 180 DAYS LAST MONTH LAST TWO WEEKS LAST EIGHT DAYS LAST TWO DAYS LAST DAY LAST HOUR Counting with conditions In the previous example we were only counting actions WHERE ActionName=”message”. It is very easy to create more interesting counters by passing in a WHERE statement as well. Let’s imagine you were interested in tracking users who had a high percentage of messages with profanity. We could easily accomplish this by tracking two counts. rules/message.sqrl LET NumMessagesWithProfanity := count( BY SessionActor WHERE TextWithStrongProfanity LAST WEEK); LET NumMessagesWithoutProfanity := count( BY SessionActor WHERE NOT TextWithStrongProfanity LAST WEEK); rules/main.sqrl INCLUDE “message.sqrl” WHERE ActionName=”message”; Here we have set up two counters – NumMessagesWithProfanity will be increased when the text contains profanity, otherwise NumMessagesWithoutProfanity will be increased. Both counters are available to be read on every action. Restrictions on conditions in WHERE clauses For reasons discussed under where expressions in our advanced documentation there are strict restrictions on what you can put in a WHERE clause. Anything other than simple equality, AND, OR, and NOT is not allowed. Since ActorAgeDays  10 is invalid inside a counter where statement, if you wanted to only count messages by new actors you’ll need to create another feature. The example below creates IsYoungActor and uses that in order to count how many messages were sent on the current ip address by users created in the last ten days. rules/message.sqrl LET IsYoungActor := ActorAgeDays  10; LET NumMessagesByYoungActorsOnIp := count(BY Ip WHERE IsYoungActor); rules/main.sqrl INCLUDE “message.sqrl” WHERE ActionName=”message”; Labeling users that use a high percentage of profanity To tie it all together we could create a rule for flagging users who have a high percentage of messages containing profanity. rules/message.sqrl LET NumMessagesWithProfanity := count( BY SessionActor WHERE TextWithStrongProfanity LAST WEEK); LET NumMessagesWithoutProfanity := count( BY SessionActor WHERE NOT TextWithStrongProfanity LAST WEEK); Keep track of total and percentage so we can use in reason string.

This is restricted to the following operations: Feature truthness, and NOT (i.e. WHERE X, WHERE NOT Y) Boolean AND/OR (i.e. WHERE X AND Y, WHERE (X AND Y) OR Z) Equality / inequality with constants (i.e. WHERE X=”A”, WHERE Y!=”B”) Implications in counter values Smyte does not automatically track every counter you could possibly use in SQRL. The simple reason for this is cost savings… since keeping track of counters costs money, and since we allow an infinite set of different counters, we can’t afford to spend infinite money on them. For most counters we’ll only start tracking the counts when you first push the count(), countUnique(), checkPercentile()or similar call to our system. It is important to identify how counters are uniquely identified in our system to avoid unintentionally starting a new counter (and losing all previous values). For example the following two counters are maintained separately: rules/main.sqrl LET LoginCount := count(BY SessionActor WHERE ActionName=”login”); LET PurchaseCount := count(BY SessionActor WHERE ActionName=”purchase”); This is to be expected. LoginCount is a count of logins, while PurchaseCount is a count of purchases. Internally we track the features used in the WHERE statement and use them to identify the counter. Using ActionName directly in count() is not recommended though, because in future you may wish to add a new action mobile_login, or perhaps change login to logged_in. Changing the constant ActionName would use a new set of counters. Instead we recommend you use additional feature: rules/main.sqrl LET IsLogin := ActionName = “login”; LET LoginCount := count(BY SessionActor WHERE IsLogin); With this change later we can safely update IsLogin. rules/main.sqrl LET IsLogin := ActionName IN [“login”, “mobile_login”]; LET LoginCount := count(BY SessionActor WHERE IsLogin); In the above case since the body of the WHERE clause did not change any previous tracked counts under the “login”action will still exist. Implications in INCLUDE statements When you include a file with a WHERE clause every statement in that file is included with that additional expression. This is most clearly demonstrated by taking the following combination of files: rules/purchase.sqrl LET NumPurchaseByActor := count(BY SessionActor); LET ManyPurchaseByActor := NumPurchaseByActor  5; CREATE RULE ManyPurchase WHERE ManyPurcaseByActor; rules/main.sqrl LET IsPurchase := ActionName = “purchase”; INCLUDE “purchase.sqrl” WHERE IsPurchase; To achieve the same thing in a single file, the equivalent SQRL code would be: rules/main.sqrl LET IsPurchase := ActionName = “purchase”; LET NumPurchaseByActor := if(IsPurchase, count(BY SessionActor WHERE IsPurchase)); LET ManyPurchaseByActor := if(IsPurchase, NumPurchaseByActor  5); CREATE RULE ManyPurchases WHERE ManyPurcaseByActor AND IsPurchase;"},"language/session.html":{"title":"","path":"/sqrl/language/session.html","body":"Sessionization is a powerful tool for combating abuse and is often used to detect anomalies, identify bots, cluster accounts, and surface other risky behavior. In this post we will explore how sessionization works and some interesting properties associated with sessions. What is a session? A session is “a unit of measurement of a user’s actions taken within a period of time or with regard to completion of a task.” In other words, sessions allow us to cluster activity from a particular time window together. SQRL (the Smyte Query and Rules Language) allows you to easily create sessions using custom keys across arbitrary timespans in real-time as your data streams in. Smyte’s definition of a session is slightly broader in that we do not restrict sessions to just users. In fact, we can create sessions that are keyed off of IP addresses, credit cards, URLs, or any feature for that matter without having to wait for complex, expensive batch jobs to run. Getting started with sessions Let’s imagine a simple case where we wanted to create a one hour session for a user. We can accomplish this with a single line of code: Simple session LET UserHourSession := sessionize(BY User EVERY 1 HOUR); From now on, whenever the user performs an action (logs in, sends a message, makes a payment, etc) we will check to see if a session exists. If no session exists, we will create a session that lasts for one hour. Creating a one hour session Creating a one hour session If the specified time elapses with no activity, the current session is destroyed. Any subsequent event will create a newsession. Creating a new session after too much time has elapsed Creating a new session after too much time has elapsed If the session does exist, then we will extend the current session’s window by an additional hour. Extending a session Extending a session It is important to note that each session gets its own unique ID. This identifier can be used in simple counters, unique counters, or rate-limits to identify suspect behavior and can even be used to determine the age of the session since we embed timestamps in all Smyte IDs. Conditional sessions In our first example, we created a simple session with no conditions; however, we can easily add qualifiers with a WHEREclause. Let’s imagine we want to create a session for any time a user sends a message. We could accomplish this with the following line of code: Conditional session LET UserMessageHourSession := sessionize( BY User EVERY 1 HOUR WHERE ActionName = “send_message” ); In this case, we only consider message events as valid actions to be grouped in a session. Session age and detecting bots As mentioned above, Smyte tracks session age through unique IDs. To show how this is useful in detecting bots, let’s consider the example above. If we call the dateDiff function, we can see how many hours have elapsed since the session was created. Session age LET UserMessageHourSession := sessionize( BY User EVERY 1 HOUR WHERE ActionName = “send_message” ); – Get session age in hours LET MessageHourSessionAgeInHours := dateDiff( “HOUR”, UserMessageHourSession, EventTimestamp ); Remember that as soon as an hour has elapsed with no activity the session is destroyed and a new one will be created. This means that if a user has a message session that is 24 hours old they have been actively sending messages for the past 24 hours straight! This type of behavior often indicates that the user is in fact a bot. Bot session Bot session With this insight, you can easily create a rule to flag and review this suspicious behavior. Session age rule CREATE RULE DayLongMessageSession WHERE MessageHourSessionAgeInHours = 24 WITH REASON “User has been sending a message for the past ${MessageHourSessionAgeInHours} hours straight”; Variance and percentile checks Another interesting way of using sessions is to cluster accounts together and look for relations or anomalous behavior. Let’s imagine we are trying to detect suspect email signups from IP addresses. Email Ip Timestamp a@gmail.com 1.2.3.4 2018-04-11T04:35:30.143Z b@gmail.com 1.2.3.4 2018-04-11T04:36:30.143Z c@gmail.com 1.2.3.4 2018-04-11T04:37:30.143Z d@email.com 1.2.3.4 2018-04-11T04:38:30.143Z e@gmail.com 1.2.3.4 2018-04-11T04:39:30.143Z f@gmail.com 1.2.3.4 2018-04-11T04:40:30.143Z Notice that all the email addresses here are of a fixed length. This is a common pattern we see when looking for fake accounts. Attackers often use scripts that generate email addresses of a fixed length, albeit with random characters. We can take advantage of sessions here to segment our data and look for an anomaly like this, since it is extremely atypical for all email addresses to be of the same length. Variance in a session LET IpSignupSessionHour := sessionize( BY Ip EVERY 1 HOUR WHERE IsSignupAction ); LET EmailLengthIpSessionVariance := variance( ActorEmailHandleLength GROUP BY IpSignupSession ); With two lines of code we can now look at the variance in email lengths across signups for a given IP address! If we wanted to create a rule to flag this we might want to add a minimum number of signups before considering this risky behavior. All this would require is counting how many total signups we have seen for this signup session. Counting with sessions LET NumSignupsByIpSignupSessionHour := count( BY IpSignupSessionHour LAST WEEK WHERE IsSignupAction ); Here, we are counting how many signups we have seen for this session over the past week. This gives us plenty of buffer in case the IP has continuous signup activity (remember that as soon as an hour with no signups elapses we will get a new session ID). To tie it all together we can create a rule like this: Variance rule LET IpSignupSessionHour := sessionize(BY Ip EVERY 1 HOUR WHERE IsSignupAction); LET EmailLengthIpSessionVariance := variance( ActorEmailHandleLength GROUP BY IpSignupSession ); LET NumSignupsByIpSignupSessionHour := count( BY IpSignupSessionHour LAST WEEK WHERE IsSignupAction ); CREATE RULE LowVarianceEmailSignup WHERE EmailLengthIpSessionVariance  1 AND NumSignupsByIpSignupSessionHour  10 WITH REASON “We have seen ${NumSignupsByIpSignupSessionHour} signups from this IP with low variance in email length”; LET IpSignupSessionHour := sessionize(BY Ip EVERY 1 HOUR WHERE IsSignupAction); LET EmailLengthIpSessionVariance := variance( ActorEmailHandleLength GROUP BY IpSignupSession ); LET NumSignupsByIpSignupSessionHour := count( BY IpSignupSessionHour LAST WEEK WHERE IsSignupAction ); CREATE RULE LowVarianceEmailSignup WHERE EmailLengthIpSessionVariance  1 AND NumSignupsByIpSignupSessionHour  10 WITH REASON “We have seen ${NumSignupsByIpSignupSessionHour} signups from this IP with low variance in email length”; Velocity The final use case for sessions that we will discuss here revolve around velocities. Velocities allow us to flag the rate or speed of which something is being done. In this example, let’s imagine we are trying to flag users who are making payments too quickly. This can be done with three lines of code using the velocity function. Session velocity – Create hour long session for payments LET PaymentSessionHour := sessionize(BY User EVERY 1 HOUR WHERE IsPaymentAction); – Track how many payments are being made in the current session LET PaymentSessionSize := count(BY PaymentSessionHour LAST DAY); – Calculate velocity / rate at which payments are being made. – The third parameter is the minimum # of events required for us to calculate velocities. LET PaymentVelocity := velocity( PaymentSessionHour, PaymentSessionSize, 3 ); velocity takes in three arguments - the session, the total size, and the minimum number of events required for us to calculate velocity. Velocities calculated here are the per/hour rate at which the action is occurring. More often than not you will have some idea of what a risky velocity might be, but sometimes you might not know this offhand or you do not want to statically set this. We can take advantage of Smyte’s streaming statistics to set these thresholds dynamically. To do this we would use the percentileCheck function. percentileCheck expects two arguments - the percentile to check against and a value. Percentile LET PaymentVelocity := velocity(PaymentSession, PaymentSessionSize, 3); LET IsPaymentVelocity99Percentile := percentileCheck(99, PaymentVelocity); CREATE RULE 99PercentilePaymentVelocity WHERE IsPaymentVelocity99Percentile WITH REASON “User is in the 99th percentile for payment velocity: ${PaymentVelocity}”; Conclusion As you can see, sessionization is a powerful tool to detect all sorts of malicious behavior - ranging from fake accounts, payment fraud, to bots and spam. At Smyte, we believe that taking a holistic approach; bringing back a human in the loop; and taking advantage of advances in stream processing are the keys to successfully combating abuse. Rather than solely relying on machine learning, we can use the abuse primitives Smyte provides in combination and create more powerful, transparent classifiers.
