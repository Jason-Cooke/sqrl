A Safe, Stateful Rules Language for Event Streams This is a beta release . The code here was used by Smyte pre-acquisition but has not been tested in a production since it was extracted from the code base. We plan to work with the community on making it production ready, but we want to set expectations correctly. We hope you find it useful. :squirrel: Why SQRL At Smyte we needed a solution that would allow our customers to write their own rules to fight spam on their websites. We wanted to provide a powerful tool but with a simple language that reads like SQL. SQRL is a language and runtime that has been used to stop a variety of attacks on large social websites and marketplaces. Getting Started To get started: 1 2 $ npm install $ ./examples/wikipedia/stream Now look at the source that is being run open examples/wikipedia/main.sqrl Extending SQRL with functions and counters The sqrl package inscludes a base set of functions that should be common to any application. None of them require any extrenal network access or databases, and fulfil the basic needs of mathematics and simple text analysis. The sqrl-text-functions includes some more advanced text analysis functions such as RE2 regular expression based pattern matching, and simhash() which returns similar values for similar text. The real power of SQRL comes with its streaming counters. While the Redis database is not the best choice for large production systems, it is one of the most wildly available and easy to set up choices. The sqrl-redis-functions builds a couple of common counters on top of this database: count() countUnique() rateLimit() sessionize() These packages are all designed as examples, we built SQRL to be extendable with functions you need, as well as new databases as you require.

Getting set up with TypeScript is out of scope for this tutorial, but as a prerequisite you should be comfortable running TypeScript code on the command line. First install the sqrl package.
